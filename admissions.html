        <p>
            Our Team has been through the process thoroughly and also utilized various Test Prep Services, Essay Writing Services, Interviewing Services, and a few college advisors as well. Said another way, we have the benefit of going through this process and filtering what we think are the best, most effective tools to help you in this process.   <br><br>

            We do not believe that we have the monopoly on very good ideas out there. We have combed through hundreds (probably thousands) of hours of YouTube videos, podcasts, and TikToks, to again pick the best advice out there – so you don’t have to.  <br><br>
            
            We will be happy to share this information/knowledge and truly welcome the active involvement of the student and the family.
